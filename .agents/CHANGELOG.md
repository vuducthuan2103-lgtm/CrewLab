# AG Kit Toolkit Changelog

## 2026.7.18

### Added

- Strict SemVer metadata for all 20 agents, 47 skills, 13 workflows, and 6 rules.
- Machine-readable `manifest.json` with agent-to-skill and workflow dependencies.
- Deterministic `manifest.lock.json` with SHA-256 integrity hashes.
- Generated `DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md` for workflow → agent → skill orchestration.
- JSON schemas for component metadata, manifest, lock, and memory topics.
- Standard memory topic files for user preferences, technical decisions, and feedback history.
- Registry and graph generation scripts with non-mutating `--check` modes.

### Changed

- Toolkit version advanced from `2026.7.12` to `2026.7.18`.
- Self-validation now checks component versions, workflow references, dependency compatibility, registry drift, lock integrity, graph drift, and memory contracts.
- CI now treats generated registry files as release artifacts that must remain synchronized.

### Compatibility

- Official runtime support remains Gemini CLI and Google Antigravity.
- The component metadata and dependency format are portable and avoid platform-specific runtime assumptions.

## 2026.7.12

- Release-safety upgrade, non-destructive CLI updates, rollback support, CI, dependency review, and hardened publishing.
